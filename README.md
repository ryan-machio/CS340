1. Writing Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Programs:
In projects like the CRUD Python module used for connecting dashboard widgets to a MongoDB database, it is essential to write maintainable, readable, and adaptable code. By focusing on modularity, each function or class in the code handles a specific task, making the codebase easy to understand and modify in the future. For instance, implementing clear documentation and following consistent naming conventions improves readability. Error handling ensures that the program runs smoothly in various scenarios, while designing reusable functions makes the code adaptable to different projects. This approach was especially useful in Project Two when working with the CRUD module, as it allowed me to efficiently connect and interact with MongoDB to display data on the dashboard, facilitating the identification of rescue dogs​.

The advantage of using the CRUD module in this way is that it abstracted the database operations, allowing the dashboard to focus on user interactions and data visualization without worrying about database connections. The module can be reused in future projects involving data manipulation or interaction with a database, providing flexibility for different types of applications. For example, this CRUD module could be extended to handle other datasets or integrated into a more complex analytics tool for real-time data updates in different industries.

2. Approaching Problems as a Computer Scientist:
As a computer scientist, I approach problems by breaking them down into manageable components, applying algorithms, and focusing on system efficiency. For the database and dashboard requirements for Grazioso Salvare, I started by understanding the client’s needs, specifically their need for filtering, visualizing, and managing data from animal shelters. I then mapped these needs to technical solutions such as interactive widgets and database queries that retrieve specific types of rescue dogs. This approach differed from other assignments where I primarily focused on theoretical aspects, as it involved a real-world problem-solving approach, integrating database management with user interface design.

In the future, I would adopt a similar approach by clearly defining client requirements before diving into design and implementation. To create databases that meet client requests, I would use techniques such as normalization to ensure efficient data storage and indexing for faster queries. Tools like MongoDB are particularly suited for dynamic and flexible datasets, which will be useful for developing scalable solutions for future clients​.

3. What Do Computer Scientists Do, and Why Does It Matter?
Computer scientists solve complex problems by developing systems, algorithms, and applications that make tasks more efficient and accessible. My work on the Grazioso Salvare project contributed to their ability to identify rescue dogs more effectively by creating a user-friendly dashboard that visualizes data and allows users to filter and categorize dogs based on various rescue needs. This type of project matters because it directly impacts the organization’s operational efficiency, enabling them to save more lives by identifying the right dogs for different rescue missions​.

By providing an intuitive tool to interact with the animal shelter’s data, the dashboard reduces user errors and improves decision-making, which is critical for Grazioso Salvare’s mission. Similarly, in other industries, computer scientists develop systems that streamline operations, improve data management, and enhance decision-making, ultimately allowing companies to work smarter and more effectively.
